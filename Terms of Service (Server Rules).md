Thanks for playing on DoharCraft! Before you start your journey, we'd like you to read through the guidelines and expectations we have for you while using our services. These rules help us ensure that all players can enjoy a positive and fun experience. Failure to adhere to these regulations will result in severe consequences.
|| Be careful with sharing access to your device or password. Players sharing the same device will be treated as alt accounts. Punishments will automatically apply to all these accounts. We may also consider your IP address when enforcing punishments in the future.
## 1. Respect yourself and others
Do not swear, curse, or hurl abuse at another player. Respect other players and treat others as you would like to be treated. Bullying is not tolerated at DoharCraft, and we will prosecute offenders accordingly.
## 2. Keep your content appropriate
Do not post inappropriate content. An excellent way to check if your content is appropriate is to ask yourself—is this something that I could show to my parents? This definition also includes material that others could potentially find offensive. Racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination is strictly prohibited.
## 3. Be considerate while chatting
Think about others and what they will see in the chat when you post a message. Do not spam; repeatedly use the exact word/phrase or excessive caps in your messages to attract attention or annoy others. Respect the fact that a chat filter is in place for a reason. Profanity is allowed to a certain degree. You must censor it appropriately and not direct it towards another player.
## 4. Listen to and respect our staff members
Our staff members are here to ensure that everyone is having a great time. When they give you instructions, we expect you to follow what they say. Keep in mind that our staff team is comprised of volunteers. They are here to help and to keep the server safe—but they are not your servants. When asking questions or engaging in conversation with them, do so in a polite manner.
## 5. Advertising/endorsing other servers is not allowed
Advertising or endorsing another Minecraft server is strictly prohibited at DoharCraft. You may mention other servers if they are used to provide a context in a conversation. However, any further discussion relating to another server will be treated as advertising.
## 6. Keep your personal information safe
While we would love to believe that there are no bad people in the world, this is unrealistic. Keep your personal information to yourself—this is the internet. Remember that all conversations and messages you send are posted on a public, likely where they will stay forever.
We also strongly recommend that you do not share your Doharcraft password with anyone. Sharing your password gives attackers full access to your account, allowing them to cheat or grief on your behalf, which could result in your account being banned. Protect your account by keeping your password safe and secure. Learn more at .
## 7. Use an appropriate username and skin or a nickname
Keep your username and skin appropriate for players of all ages. Prohibited skins may provide an advantage, such as one that uses custom geometry and not the "Alex" or "Steve" skin structure or ones that show excessive body parts.
## 8. Be thoughtful of your teammates and other players
Keep them in mind when playing in a match where you are placed in a team with other players. Trying to troll, grief or kill them is not acceptable.
## 9. Report a bug instead of abusing it
We prohibit abusing bugs to your advantage, even if you have already reported them to our team. If you find such game-breaking bugs, you should report them to @DoharCraft on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/doharcraft-1107294702279065761) immediately and file reports for players who are using these bugs to their advantage.
## 10. Accept the punishment
Attempting to evade your punishment, or providing assistance to another player to evade theirs, is strictly prohibited. There are rules and an appropriate punishment system in place, and by using/playing on our services, you agree to follow these guidelines to help ensure everyone has a positive experience.
## ConclusionWe reserve the right to change these rules without prior notice or consultation with the broader community, which may come into effect immediately. We may also exercise the right to ban and refuse service or limit service access to any player/user at our discretion, regardless of whether they have broken the above regulations.
Thanks for playing on DoharCraft—we hope to see you soon!
