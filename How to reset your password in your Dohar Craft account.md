Hey, we've all been there. Passwords are supposed to be difficult! When itâ€™s time to set up a new password, you can check out this article for how to do so.
# Password Requirements
|| Note: This is currently part of an experiment to a small group of users.
When making your password for your DoharCraft account, it must be a minimum of 8 characters. We will not accept passwords that are less than 8 characters.

Be sure to use a secure password that you don't use anywhere else. Longer passwords are usually more secure than passwords with more symbols, numbers, or cases of letters. Using a password manager is a great way to generate, secure, and use strong passwords for each site you log in to.

Depending on your region, additional password requirements may apply.
# Where To Reset Your Password
If you want to change your password and you know your current password, you can reset the password in your **Secuirty Management**
### Desktop And Browser Clients
Press on your Username in your navigation bar, then click on **My Account**, then click on Security Settings and reset your password there.
## Mobile Clients
For iOS/Android
You will see 3 lines in the right corner of your navigation bar, click on it. Then in your username. Go to my accounts and then edit security settings.
