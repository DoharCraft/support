We recommend using **2FA (Two Factor Authentication)** while using DoharCraft, as it secures your account more. Please make sure to backup your data before enabling 2 Factor Authentication. If you lose your authentication account then you can recover it from contacting DoharCraft Support Team

Once you click the enable button, you'll see a new 3 step prompt pop up. To begin the 2FA process, you'll either need to download Google Authenticator or Authy on your mobile device. Either one of these programs will work here.
# Authenticate Me, Google!
If you're using Google Authenticator, you'll be prompted to choose your input method, either scanning a barcode or entering a provided key:

Either one of these will work fine (since DoharCraft provides both input methods) but keep in mind, Google Authenticator on Android will need you to install another barcode scanning app if you want to use that option. They require the ZXingBarcode Scanner app, which is totally fine and dandy:

This'll generate a 6 digit code that is the final piece to enabling 2FA in The box. Enter it in, and you're good to go.
